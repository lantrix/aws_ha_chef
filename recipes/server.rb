# This recipe only installs the Chef core server software, but does not configure it.
# It can be used on both front-end and back-end servers.

#Need to update before installing chef-server-core

  command 'dpkg --configure -a'
end

# Use the 'server_file' helper to strip filename off the end of URLs.
# This way you don't have to store URLs and filenames separately.
